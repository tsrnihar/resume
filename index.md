* Price elasticity of new ticket structure – Shifting travel dates versus drop-out
* Sensitivity of multi-day ticket purchase intenders to seasonality and multi-day ticket discount levels

# Microsoft Emotional Modelling – Estimate the emotional trace of an Ad
* Batch test ads to understand market context
* Screen ads for smaller brands or secondary campaign assets
* Evaluate different versions of the same ad, such as different lengths and calls to action
* Spend money only on content that’s proven to work

# Vodafone – Driver modelling
* Estimate the Relative influence of Emotional and Functional Drivers on LTR, NPS.
* Built an Excel simulator to understand the change in various touchpoints – LTR, NPS, NSS – when each of drivers are changed.
* Used Confirmatory Factor Analysis to come up with themes from the granular attributes.

```python
// I am proficient in Python
def ideal_job(name):
  if name == "Nihar":
    requirements = "Product company where I can be a full stack data-scientist"
  return requirements

ideal_job("Nihar")

```

## MODELLING TECHNIQUES
### Statistical models
* Regression (Lasso, Ridge, Linear)
* Choice Models (Multinomial Logit, Nested Logit, Mixed Logit)
* clustering – LADI (LAtent DIscriminant model), K-means
* Driver models – Dominance, SEM

### Machine learning models and others
* Random Forrest, GBM, CART
* Topic Modelling – Mallet LDA
* Introductory knowledge in RNNs, CNNs
